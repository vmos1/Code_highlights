# Code_highlights
Highlighting codes from a few projects


## 1. Lattice Multigrid solver in 2D for Laplace and Wilson operators

## 2. Multi-exponential fit of the 4-point function in R x S^2

## 3. Conditional GANs to generate mass distributions in the early universe
We develop conditional Generative Adversarial Neural networks (cGANs) to produce maps of the universe, conditioned on the cosmological paramters $\sigma$.
The models are trained with images obtained from N-body simulations. The goal is to use cGANs to obtain novel images in regions of parameter space not explored by N-body simulations.
