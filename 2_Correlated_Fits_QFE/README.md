# Fit the antipodal 4 pt function to the expected form of a tower of exponentials
The goal is to fit the antipodal four-point function to the expect form.
For the test data given here, which is for the free theory, the form is a series of integer exponents. 

These exponential fits are quite challenging and unstable.
